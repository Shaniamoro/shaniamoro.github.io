    <p> Hi, I'm Shania I recently graduated from Midwestern State University where I majored in Mathematics and minored in
        computer science. Whenever I found myself in a situation to assist others I do so willingly and so I organized a lot
        of study groups in college and even started tutoring mathematics in my senior year.
        I am very passionate about mathematics and while I was in school, I was the president of math club, so I had
        many opportunities to attend math conferences and even presented at the maa Texas section meeting in my senior
        year. It was through attending these conferences that I discovered the world of opportunities that mathematics
        entailed in terms of careers and this furthered my interest in the applied field of mathematics with careers
        such as data analysis and actuarial science. Since graduating, I have been educating myself on the tools that
        are useful in my field such as Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Tableau and so much more.
